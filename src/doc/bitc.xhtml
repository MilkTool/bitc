    <h1 class="title">The BitC Programming Language</h1>
    <p>
      BitC is a new systems programming language. It seeks to combine
      the flexibility, safety, and richness of Standard ML or Haskell with the
      low-level expressiveness of C.

	site makes use of SVG images. If your browser supports SVG, or
	you have an SVG plugin installed, you should see an SVG logo
	to the left of this paragraph. Recent versions of Microsoft's
	Internet Explorer, Apple's Safari, and Linux FireFox browsers
	include support for SVG.  If your Linux distribution ships an
	older version of Mozilla or Firefox, installing Adobe's <a
	href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/">plugin</a>
	will allow you to view these images.

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      The BitC
      project has several objectives:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>Correct some of the shortcomings of the earlier EROS
	  design.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>Demonstrate that an atomic kernel design scales
	  <em>up</em> as well as down. We are planning to bring up
	  versions of Coyotos on large-scale multiprocessors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>Provide an efficient linux compatibility environment for
	  use as a transitional runtime system, so that we can
	  explore adapting applications to a more secure API
	  foundation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>Construct the kernel and key utilities in a new systems
	  programming language (BitC) with a well-defined,
	  mechanically-specified semantics. This will allow us to
	  formally verify security and correctness properties of
	  the system and its key utilities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>Develop the proving technology necessary to do useful
	  verification about a project of this sort.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Target Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      The BitC bootstrap compiler compiles to portable ANSI_C code. By
      tweaking a single header file it is possible to port BitC
      bootstrap output to essentially any target platform.
    </p>
    <h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
    <p>
      At present, the main mailing list for the BitC project is <a
      href="http://www.bitc-lang.org/mailman/listinfo/bitc-dev">bitc-dev</a>.
      These lists are intended primarily for developers and
      architects. When a release exists, we will add a user-oriented
      list as well.
