    <h1 class="title">The Path to BitC</h1>
    <p>
      At some point during the <a
	href="http://www.coyotos.org">Coyotos</a> project, we realized
	that we wanted a safer and more expressive programming
	language. Also, we wanted a language that we could analyze
	more readily using model checkers and formal verifiers. BitC
	is a first step toward realizing this objective.
