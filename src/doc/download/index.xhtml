    <h1 class="title">BitC Download Page</h1>
    <p>
      The first BitC compiler is converging rapidly, but it isn't
      complete yet. We have a few remaining items in the <a
      href="../browse/compiler/ToDo.html">to-do list</a> to complete. If you are
      interested in experimenting, or you want to help us debug the
      language, it's far enough along to download and write programs
      in. You can also browse the code for
      the <a href="../browse/compiler/index.html">compiler</a> or 
      the <a href="../browse/libbitc/index.html">runtime library</a> on-line
      if you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The easiest way to obtain the BitC source is to copy it
      using rsync:
    </p>
    <pre class="literallayout">
rsync -avz rsync://www.bitc-lang.org/src.bitc/ bitc/</pre>
    <p>
      You can also obtain it using <command>mercurial</command>:
    </p>
    <pre class="literallayout">
hg clone http://dev.eros-os.com/hg/bitc</pre>
    <p>
      Whichever way you fetch it, you then need to:
    </p>
    <pre class="literallayout">
cd bitc/src
# Set CXXFLAGS so that you can help us debug the compiler:
CXXFLAGS=-g ./configure
make</pre>
    <p>
      If you are trying to track the development updates as we go,
      it's always a good idea to run:
    </p>
    <pre class="literallayout">
cd bitc/src
# Set CXXFLAGS so that you can help us debug the compiler:
CXXFLAGS=-g ./configure
make clean
make</pre>
    <p indent="no">
      Because we are still making changes to makefiles that are
      generated using configure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When releases and/or
      source are available for download, an item will appear in the
      <b>News</b> pane.
