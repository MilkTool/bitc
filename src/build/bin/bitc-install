# This script is command-line compatible with the LINUX install utility,
# but avoids unnecessary copies by checking for actual changes before
# installing the file.
#
# A useful trick that this program takes advantage of is that
# running chmod/chown do NOT change a file's modification time.
#
# install can be invoked as:
#
#	install [options] -d dir_name ...
#	install [options] [ -s ] file inst_file
#	install [options] [ -s ] file... inst_dir
#
# where the 'options' are:
#
#	[-c] [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner]
#
# we do not support the gnuish style options.
#
# Note that BSD install destroys the source file (idiots) unless
# you pass '-c', so in non-directory cases we pass '-c'.

  # Hack alert: It is both cumbersome and awkward to need to use
  # a series of "coyinstall -d" commands to ensure that the
  # full directory path is populated, and for the most part
  # we don't actually care about directory ownership except in
  # rare leaf directories.
  #
  # We therefore borrow a trick here from "mkinstalldirs" and
  # fabricate all directories along the path as needed, using
  # the specified user and group ONLY for those directories that
  # we actually create.
  #
  # Note this means that if you want a leaf directory a/b/c to have
  # unusual ownership, you may need to:
  #
  #    coyinstall -d a/b
  #    coyinstall -u user -g group a/b/c
  #
  # to ensure that the leading path is already created.
