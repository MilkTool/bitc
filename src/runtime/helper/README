This directory contains two "helper" programs that are not normally
run as part of the library build.


genops.sh:   When code is emitted via the gen-c.cxx back end, the file
             bitc/runtime.h is included at the top of all BitC
             compiler output files. In that file, there is a
             depressingly long series of built-in operations that
             define sign extension, zero extension, and truncation
             operators on bitfields. These are, to put it mildly,
             a royal pain in the ass to update, because there are so
             many entries.

             The genops.sh emits them automatically.

gen.cxx:     This is a similar file whose purpose was to emit a bunch
             of instance definitions that made every bitfield type a
             member of the Integral type class. This turned out to be
             a bad idea, and the file is probably now stale.
