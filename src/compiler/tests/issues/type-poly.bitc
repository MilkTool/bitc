(bitc-version "0.10")
;; As of now, we do not permit a type to be polymorphic within its own
;; definition. For example, the following union definition is rejected
;; by the compiler with the error message:
;; Type Error.Expected 'a, Obtained int32
;; The question is whether we must permit this? If so, how should it
;; be done with the eqi-recursion that we have?
;; ML permits this, and Ocaml permits this even with -rectypes
;; option.
