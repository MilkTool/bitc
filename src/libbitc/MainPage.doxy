/// On these pages you can browse the source code for the BitC runtime
/// library and examine its source documentation, which is still a
/// work in progress. All architectures are documented simultaneously,
/// which means (for example) that there are multiple
/// implementations of bitc_emit_procedure_object.  This is intentional.
